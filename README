The EnergyCorrelator package is based on the physics described in:

   Energy Correlation Functions for Jet Substructure.
   Andrew J. Larkoski, Gavin Salam, and Jesse Thaler.
   arXiv:1203.soon.

There are three FunctionOfPseudoJet in this package:

EnergyCorrelator(int N, double beta, ecmode mode)
  Called ECF(N,beta) in the publication.  N is the multiplicity, beta is the angular exponent, and mode = pT_R (default) or E_Omega sets how energies and angles are determined.

EnergyCorrelatorRatio(int N, double beta, ecmode mode)
  Called r_N^(beta) in the publication.  Equals ECF(N+1,beta)/ECF(N,beta).

EnergyCorrelatorDoubleRatio(int N, double beta, ecmode mode)
  Called C_N^(beta) in the publication.  Equals r_N/r_{N-1}.  This is the recommended function for boosted N-prong object discrimination.  (N=1 for quark/gluon, N=2 for boosted W/Z/H, N=3 for boosted top)

Usage is shown in the example.cc program.
