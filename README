The EnergyCorrelator package is based on the physics described in:

   Energy Correlation Functions for Jet Substructure.
   Andrew J. Larkoski, Gavin Salam, and Jesse Thaler.
   arXiv:1305.0007.

Additional information and new observables formed from the 
energy correlation functions was described in

   Power Counting to Better Jet Observables.
   Andrew J. Larkoski, Ian Moult, and Duff Neill.
   arXiv:1409.6298.

This FastJet-contrib package contains four classes derived from
FunctionOfPseudoJet<double> :

EnergyCorrelator(int N, double beta, Measure measure)

  Called ECF(N,beta) in arXiv:1305.0007.  Corresponds to the N-point
  correlation function, with beta the angular exponent, while measure
  = pt_R (default) or E_theta sets how energies and angles are
  determined.

EnergyCorrelatorRatio(int N, double beta, Measure measure)

  Called r_N^(beta) in arXiv:1305.0007.  
  Equals ECF(N+1,beta)/ECF(N,beta).

EnergyCorrelatorDoubleRatio(int N, double beta, Measure measure)

  Called C_N^(beta) in arXiv:1305.0007.  Equals r_N/r_{N-1}.  This 
  observable provides good boosted N-prong object discrimination.
  (N=1 for quark/gluon, N=2 for boosted W/Z/H, N=3 for boosted top)

EnergyCorrelatorD2(double beta, Measure measure)

  Called D_2^(beta) in arXiv:1409.6298.  Equals ECF(3,beta)*ECF(1,beta)^3/ECF(2,beta)^3.  
  This is the recommended function for boosted 2-prong object discrimination 
  (boosted W/Z/H).

Usage is shown in the example.cc program.
